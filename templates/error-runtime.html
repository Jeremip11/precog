    <h2>Precog Error</h2>
    
    <p>
        Something went wrong building the preview. Hereâ€™s what I know:
    </p>
    
    <pre>{{error.args[0]}}</pre>
    
    {% if error.args[0] == codes.NO_REF_STATUS %}
        <p>
            This might mean that Circle CI tests were not run, and no
            <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/">commit status</a>
            for the ref <q>{{git_ref}}</q> was created.
        </p>
